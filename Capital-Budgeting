## Executive Summary

Led the financial feasibility analysis for **GreenVolt Energy Ltd**, evaluating a €65M investment in a 50 MW solar power plant in Southern Spain. Built a 20-year cash flow model incorporating solar degradation, tax shields, WACC-based discounting, and dividend policy impacts. 

**Investment Decision:** **APPROVED** - Project generates positive NPV of €7.6M (12.7% IRR) but requires careful attention to financing structure, as shareholder returns are highly sensitive to dividend policy and electricity price fluctuations.

**Critical Finding:** While project economics are sound (IRR > WACC), aggressive dividend policies destroy shareholder value—at 10% dividend payout, shareholder NPV becomes **-€49.3M** with negative IRR (-12.2%).

## Project Context

### Business Case
**GreenVolt Energy Ltd** evaluating construction of 50 MW solar photovoltaic plant in Southern Spain:
- **Initial Investment:** €60M (Year 0 - EPC costs)
- **Additional CapEx:** €5M (Year 3 - grid upgrade + inverter replacement)
- **Revenue Model:** 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at €85/MWh
- **Project Life:** 20 years
- **Expected Output:** 120,000 MWh in Year 1

### Strategic Question
Is this project financially viable considering:
1. Solar panel degradation (0.5% annually)
2. Long-term debt obligations
3. Shareholder return expectations (dividend policy)
4. Market risks (electricity price volatility, WACC changes)

---

## Methodology

### 1. Financial Model Architecture

Built comprehensive 20-year cash flow model with three perspectives:

**A. Project-Level Analysis (Unlevered)**
- Evaluated project economics independent of financing structure
- Focus: Does the project create value as a standalone business?

**B. Shareholder-Level Analysis (Levered)**
- Incorporated dividend payments and financing costs
- Focus: What returns do equity investors actually receive?

**C. Integrated P&L and Cash Flow**
- Full income statement cascade: Revenue → EBITDA → EBIT → Net Income
- Cash flow decomposition: CFO (operations) + CFI (investments) + CFF (financing)

### 2. Key Model Components

**Revenue Modeling:**
```
Year 1 Revenue = 120,000 MWh × €85/MWh = €10.2M
Year N Revenue = Year (N-1) Output × (1 - 0.5%) × €85/MWh
```
- Incorporated 0.5% annual degradation in solar panel efficiency
- Fixed PPA price (€85/MWh) for 20-year contract

**Cost Structure:**
- **OPEX:** €1.5M annually (2% of initial investment) - O&M, insurance, land lease
- **Depreciation:** 
  - Initial CapEx: €3M/year (€60M / 20 years straight-line)
  - Additional CapEx: €294K/year (€5M / 17 remaining years from Year 3)
- **Tax Rate:** 25% corporate tax

**Financing Assumptions:**
- **WACC:** 8% (weighted average cost of capital)
- **Dividend Policy:** 5% of total invested capital paid annually from Year 2 onwards
- **Total Capital:** €65M (€60M + €5M)

### 3. Valuation Metrics Calculated

**A. Net Present Value (NPV)**
- Discounted all cash flows at 8% WACC
- Separate NPV calculations for project vs. shareholders

**B. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
- Solved for discount rate where NPV = 0
- Compared to WACC to assess value creation

**C. Payback Period**
- Calculated cumulative cash flows to identify break-even year

## Key Financial Results

### Project-Level Economics (Unlevered)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **NPV** | **€7,623,117** | Project creates €7.6M in value |
| **IRR** | **9.63%** | Exceeds WACC of 8% by 163 bps |
| **Payback Period** | **Year 9** | Capital recovery within half of project life |

**Assessment:** Project is economically viable from pure business case perspective.

### Shareholder Returns (Levered - Base Case)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **NPV to Shareholders** | **-€20,863,810** | Shareholders lose €20.9M in present value |
| **IRR to Shareholders** | **2.71%** | Well below WACC of 8% |
| **Payback Period** | **Year 4** | Faster payback but poor long-term returns |

**Critical Insight:** The 5% annual dividend policy (€3.25M/year starting Year 2) destroys shareholder value. While dividends provide cash returns, they prevent capital accumulation needed to generate higher long-term returns.

### Year-by-Year Performance Highlights

**Year 1:**
- Revenue: €10.2M
- EBITDA: €8.7M (85% margin - excellent)
- Net Income: €4.35M
- Free Cash Flow: €7.275M

**Year 10 (Steady State):**
- Revenue: €9.75M (after degradation)
- EBITDA: €8.25M
- Net Income: €3.94M
- Cumulative FCF: €71.0M (project has paid back and is generating positive returns)

**Year 20 (End of Life):**
- Revenue: €9.15M (cumulative 10% degradation)
- Net Income: €3.40M
- Total Cumulative FCF: €129.9M

## Sensitivity Analysis: Strategic Risk Assessment

### 1. Dividend Policy Impact Analysis

Tested three scenarios: 1%, 5% (base), and 10% dividend payout rates

| Dividend Rate | Project NPV | Project IRR | Shareholder NPV | Shareholder IRR |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **1%** | €7.6M | 9.63% | **+€1.9M** ✅ | **8.42%** ✅ |
| **5% (Base)** | €7.6M | 9.63% | **-€20.9M** ❌ | 2.71% |
| **10%** | €7.6M | 9.63% | **-€49.4M** ❌ | **-12.16%** ❌ |

**Critical Finding:** 
- Project NPV unchanged (dividends don't affect business operations)
- Shareholder NPV **collapses dramatically** as dividend policy becomes more aggressive
- **Only 1% dividend policy creates positive shareholder value (+€1.9M NPV, 8.42% IRR)**

**Strategic Implication:** Company should adopt **minimal dividend policy** and reinvest cash flows, then execute larger capital return in later years when project has proven itself.

### 2. Electricity Price Sensitivity

Analyzed impact of ±€10/MWh variation in PPA price

| PPA Price (€/MWh) | Project NPV | Project IRR | Shareholder NPV | Shareholder IRR |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **75 (−12%)** | **-€910K** ❌ | 7.80% | -€29.4M | 0.13% |
| **85 (Base)** | **€7.6M** ✅ | 9.63% | -€20.9M | 2.71% |
| **95 (+12%)** | **€16.2M** ✅ | 11.39% | -€12.3M | 5.00% |

**Key Insights:**
- **€8.5M NPV swing** per €10 price movement (high revenue sensitivity)
- Project becomes **unprofitable below €75/MWh** (NPV negative)
- Even at €95/MWh (optimistic), shareholders still see negative NPV due to dividend drag
- IRR highly sensitive: 360 bps range across scenarios (7.8% to 11.4%)

**Risk Assessment:** PPA price is the single biggest risk factor. Securing long-term contracts at €85+ is critical.

### 3. Cost of Capital (WACC) Sensitivity

Tested impact of ±2% WACC variation

| WACC | Project NPV | Shareholder NPV | Interpretation |
|------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **6% (−2%)** | **€19.2M** ✅ | -€14.6M | Lower discount rate significantly increases value |
| **8% (Base)** | **€7.6M** ✅ | -€20.9M | Base case |
| **10% (+2%)** | **-€1.5M** ❌ | -€25.9M | Project becomes NPV-negative |

**Critical Finding:**
- **€20.7M NPV swing** across 4% WACC range (extreme sensitivity)
- At 10% WACC, **project is no longer viable** (NPV negative)
- IRR of 9.63% provides only **163 bps cushion** above base WACC

**Financing Strategy Implication:** Company must secure low-cost financing. Project becomes unviable if financing costs rise above ~9.5%.

### 4. CapEx Overrun Risk

Analyzed impact of Year 3 additional investment variation

| Year 3 CapEx (€M) | Project NPV | Project IRR | NPV Impact | IRR Impact |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **€3M (−40%)** | €9.0M | 9.95% | +€1.4M | +0.32% |
| **€5M (Base)** | €7.6M | 9.63% | Baseline | Baseline |
| **€7M (+40%)** | €6.2M | 9.32% | -€1.4M | -0.31% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Low sensitivity** to CapEx overruns (±€1.4M NPV per €2M variation)
- Even at 40% cost overrun, project remains viable (NPV still positive)
- Grid upgrade costs are relatively immaterial to overall project economics

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Decision: **APPROVE** with Conditions

**Rationale:** Project generates positive NPV (€7.6M) and IRR exceeds WACC (9.63% > 8.0%), demonstrating value creation at the business level.

### Critical Success Factors

**1. Optimize Dividend Policy (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

**Recommendation:** Implement **1% dividend payout** (€650K annually) instead of 5%

**Impact:**
- Shareholder NPV: +€1.9M (vs. -€20.9M in base case) - **€22.8M improvement**
- Shareholder IRR: 8.42% (vs. 2.71%) - exceeds WACC
- Allows capital accumulation for future reinvestment or larger distribution in Year 15-20

**Alternative Strategy:** Zero dividends for first 10 years, then distribute accumulated cash in Years 11-20 when project has proven stable cash generation.

**2. Lock in PPA Price (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Risk:** At €75/MWh, project NPV becomes negative (-€910K)

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Secure **20-year fixed PPA** at minimum €85/MWh before construction
- Consider hedging with 25-year PPA (vs. 20-year) to capture value beyond Year 20
- Build in price escalation clause tied to inflation (CPI + 1%)

**Target:** Lock in €90+/MWh if possible (would add €8.5M to NPV)

**3. Optimize Capital Structure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Issue:** 8% WACC leaves only 163 bps cushion above minimum viable rate

**Financing Strategy:**
- Target 60/40 debt-to-equity ratio vs. current structure
- Secure project finance at <6% interest rate (leverages government green energy incentives)
- Consider green bonds or EU renewable energy subsidies to lower cost of capital

**Impact:** Reducing WACC to 6% would increase NPV by €11.6M to €19.2M

**4. Manage CapEx Risk (LOW PRIORITY)**

**Observation:** Year 3 CapEx sensitivity is low (±40% = ±€1.4M NPV)

**Actions:**
- Negotiate fixed-price contract for grid upgrade with penalty clauses
- Pre-order inverters to lock in pricing and avoid supply chain delays
- Set aside €2M contingency reserve (40% buffer)

### Medium-term Optimization (Years 3-10)

**5. Operational Efficiency Focus**
- Target OPEX reduction from €1.5M to €1.3M (13% decrease) through:
  - Predictive maintenance using IoT sensors (reduce unplanned downtime)
  - Automated panel cleaning systems (improve efficiency without labor costs)
  - Renegotiate insurance premiums after 5 years of incident-free operation

**6. Revenue Enhancement**
- Investigate **merchant market exposure** after Year 10 if spot prices exceed €85/MWh
- Explore additional revenue streams:
  - Grid balancing services (frequency regulation)
  - Capacity payments from TSO (transmission system operator)
  - Virtual power plant participation

### Long-term Strategy (Years 10-20)

**7. Exit Strategy Planning**
- Year 15: Evaluate sale to infrastructure fund at 8-10x EBITDA multiple
- Year 18: Consider refinancing to extract equity while maintaining operations
- Year 20: Negotiate plant life extension to 25-30 years if degradation is <15%

## Key Learning Outcomes

### 1. Project vs. Shareholder Returns Diverge
**Insight:** A project can have excellent business case economics (9.63% IRR, €7.6M NPV) while simultaneously destroying shareholder value (-€20.9M shareholder NPV) due to poor financing and dividend decisions.

**Application:** In infrastructure investing, capital structure and distribution policy matter as much as operational performance.

### 2. Sensitivity Analysis Reveals Strategic Priorities
**Insight:** Not all risks are equal. PPA price (€8.5M NPV swing per €10 price change) and WACC (€20.7M swing per 4% change) dominate all other factors.

**Application:** Financial analysis should drive resource allocation—focus 80% of negotiation effort on securing low-cost financing and favorable PPA terms.

### 3. Dividend Policy as Strategic Lever
**Insight:** In capital-intensive projects, aggressive dividend policies prevent compound value creation. The €22.8M improvement from 5% → 1% dividend policy is larger than many operational improvements.

**Application:** Patient capital wins in infrastructure—prioritize reinvestment over early distribution.

### 4. IRR Cushion Matters
**Insight:** A 163 bps cushion (9.63% IRR vs. 8% WACC) provides minimal margin of safety. Small changes in financing costs can make projects unviable.

**Application:** Target minimum 300 bps IRR-WACC spread for infrastructure projects given their long duration risk.
