# Multiscale Modeling of Supramolecular Systems

## Overview
This repository contains the computational models and analysis tools developed during my PhD research on **supramolecular polymers** and **nanoparticle-membrane interactions** using molecular dynamics simulations.

## Research Projects

### 1. Supramolecular Polymer Dynamics
**Controlling Exchange Pathways via Defect Management**

- Developed coarse-grained MARTINI models for BTA-based supramolecular fibers
- Investigated how defects regulate monomer exchange with solvent
- Established structure-dynamics relationships: directional vs. non-directional interactions control defect formation
- Used enhanced sampling (metadynamics) and machine learning (SOAP-PAMM) to characterize exchange pathways
- **Key finding**: Tuning monomer solvophobicity and core geometry enables rational design of exchange dynamics

### 2. Nanoparticle-Membrane Interactions
**Phase Separation Disruption by Amphiphilic Gold Nanoparticles**

- Studied MUS:OT gold nanoparticles (2-4 nm) interacting with multidomain lipid membranes
- Combined MD simulations with AFM and QCM-D experiments
- Discovered NPs suppress lipid rafts in concentration-dependent manner
- Observed spontaneous formation of ordered 2D NP supralattices within membranes
- **Key finding**: Lipid-lipid enthalpy changes drive phase separation disruption

## Methods
- **Coarse-grained MD**: MARTINI force field (GROMACS)
- **Enhanced sampling**: Well-tempered metadynamics, umbrella sampling
- **Analysis**: Supervised/unsupervised clustering, PCA, free energy calculations
