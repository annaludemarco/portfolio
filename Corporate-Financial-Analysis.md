## Executive Summary

Led a comprehensive financial health assessment of a mid-sized manufacturing company, developing both reclassified Balance Sheet and Income Statement, calculating 15+ financial ratios, and providing strategic recommendations on liquidity management and capital structure optimization.

**Key Finding:** The company showed strong operational performance (44% gross margin) but critical liquidity issues (Current Ratio: 1.10, below safe threshold) and concerning debt service coverage (DSCR < 1.0, indicating default risk).

---

## Project Context

**Challenge:** Analyze the financial health of a company using unstructured accounting data and provide actionable insights on:
- Short-term liquidity and solvency
- Capital structure adequacy
- Operational efficiency
- Return on investment for shareholders

**Approach:** Systematic financial statement analysis using international best practices for ratio analysis and financial statement reclassification.

## Methodology

### 1. Financial Statement Reclassification

**Balance Sheet Restructuring:**
- Reorganized raw accounting data into functional categories (Fixed Assets, Current Assets, Equity, Long-term Debt, Current Liabilities)
- Calculated missing values using accounting equations (Short-term financial debt: €63,140)
- Created percentage composition analysis for both assets and liabilities

**Income Statement Reclassification:**
- Built cascading P&L from Revenue to Net Income
- Calculated intermediate profitability measures: Gross Profit, EBITDA, EBIT
- Applied 36% tax rate to derive after-tax results

**Key Figures:**
- Total Assets: €1,008,240
- Revenue: €890,000
- Net Income: €212,480
- Gross Margin: 52.8%

### 2. Comprehensive Ratio Analysis

Calculated 15 financial ratios across 4 dimensions:

**A. Liquidity Analysis**
- Current Ratio: 1.10 (Marginally adequate - target >1.5)
- Quick Ratio: 0.31 (Critical - indicates severe liquidity stress)

**B. Operational Efficiency**
- Inventory Turnover: 4.88x (73 days inventory period)
- Receivables Turnover: 77.39x (4.7 days collection period - excellent)
- Payables Turnover: 9.57x (38 days payment period)
- Cash Conversion Cycle: 39 days (reasonable)

**C. Profitability Metrics**
- ROE (Return on Equity): 44.27% (strong equity returns)
- ROI (Return on Investment): 33.17% (efficient capital utilization)
- ROA (Return on Assets): 21.08% (solid asset productivity)
- Net Margin: 23.87% (healthy profitability)
- EPS: €2.23 per share

**D. Financial Structure & Solvency**
- Primary Structure Ratio: 0.55 (Fixed assets not fully covered by equity - concern)
- Secondary Structure Ratio: 1.00 (Just adequate when including long-term debt)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 1.09 (Moderate leverage)
- Debt-to-Assets Ratio: 0.52 (52% assets financed by debt)
- Debt Service Coverage Ratio: 0.90 (Below 1.0 - indicates default risk)

## Key Insights & Strategic Implications

### Critical Finding #1: Liquidity Crisis
**Issue:** Current Ratio of 1.10 and Quick Ratio of 0.31 indicate insufficient liquid assets to cover short-term obligations.

**Root Cause:** 
- High inventory relative to liquid assets (€86,000 inventory vs €21,500 cash)
- Short-term financial debt of €63,140 straining immediate liquidity

**Risk:** Company may struggle to meet obligations in case of revenue shocks or supplier payment acceleration.

### Critical Finding #2: Debt Service Vulnerability
**Issue:** DSCR of 0.90 means the company generates only 90 cents of operating cash flow for every euro of debt service.

**Implication:** Company is technically in financial distress and may require debt restructuring or capital injection.

### Strength: Strong Operational Performance
**Positive:** 
- High gross margin (52.8%) indicates strong pricing power or operational efficiency
- Excellent receivables collection (4.7 days) demonstrates effective credit management
- Strong ROE (44.27%) shows the company creates significant value for shareholders

### Structure Concern: Fixed Asset Financing
**Issue:** Primary structure ratio of 0.55 indicates that only 55% of fixed assets are financed by equity.

**Meaning:** The company is using short-term and long-term debt to finance long-term assets, which creates maturity mismatch risk.

---

## Working Capital Analysis

**Current Working Capital:** €11,100  
**Assessment:** Inadequate buffer for operations

The company operates with minimal working capital cushion (less than 5 days of revenue), which explains the liquidity stress. The low working capital combined with high inventory holdings suggests:
- Potential overstock or slow-moving inventory issues
- Need for better inventory management
- Insufficient cash reserves for operational flexibility

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)

1. **Capital Injection via Equity**
   - **Calculated Solution:** Issue 24,915 new shares at €4/share to raise €99,660
   - **Impact:** Would increase Current Assets to €220,000, improving Current Ratio to 2.02
   - **Trade-off:** Dilution of existing shareholders by ~26%

2. **Inventory Optimization**
   - Target: Reduce inventory by 20% (€17,200) to free up cash
   - Action: Implement just-in-time ordering or promotional campaigns to move slow stock

3. **Renegotiate Short-term Debt**
   - Convert €30,000 of short-term debt to long-term financing
   - Would immediately improve Current Ratio to 1.37

### Medium-term Strategy (3-12 months)

4. **Improve DSCR**
   - Increase EBITDA by 15% through cost optimization (target: €438,000)
   - OR reduce debt burden by €100,000
   - Target DSCR > 1.25 for financial stability

5. **Optimize Capital Structure**
   - Gradually shift from debt to equity financing for fixed assets
   - Target Primary Structure Ratio > 0.70 within 2 years

## Project Impact & Learning Outcomes

**Team Leadership:** Successfully coordinated analysis across 6 team members, ensuring consistency in calculations and coherent narrative flow.

**Key Takeaway:** Financial ratios tell a story beyond the numbers. This company had strong operational performance (high margins, good ROE) but dangerous structural weaknesses (liquidity and debt service). The analysis demonstrated that profitability alone doesn't guarantee financial health - liquidity and capital structure are equally critical.

**Business Acumen Developed:** Understanding the trade-offs between leverage (which boosts ROE) and financial stability (which requires lower debt and higher liquidity buffers).
