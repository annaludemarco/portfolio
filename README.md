# Finance Projects

Financial modeling and analysis projects completed during Executive Master in Finance and Financial Markets at Rome Business School (2024-2025). All projects led as Team Leader of 6-7 person teams.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Corporate Financial Analysis](./corporate-financial-analysis.md)
**Skills:** Financial Statement Analysis | Ratio Analysis | Working Capital Management  
Analyzed corporate financial health using balance sheet and income statement reclassification. Calculated 15+ financial ratios and identified critical liquidity crisis (Current Ratio: 1.10, DSCR < 1.0). Recommended equity injection and debt restructuring strategies.

### 2. [Solar Capital Budgeting: 50 MW Plant Investment](./solar-capital-budgeting.md)
**Skills:** DCF Analysis | NPV/IRR | Sensitivity Analysis | WACC Calculation  
Evaluated €65M solar plant investment with 20-year cash flow model. Identified that 5% dividend policy destroyed €22.8M shareholder value vs. 1% policy. Project NPV: €7.6M (IRR: 9.63%). Recommended approval with optimized dividend structure.

### 3. [MicroTech Semiconductor Valuation](./microtech-valuation.md)
**Skills:** DCF | Comparable Company Analysis | CAPM | Beta Relevering  
Dual-methodology equity valuation combining DCF (€5.00/share) and market multiples (EV/EBITDA: €6.66/share). Unlevered and relevered peer betas to calculate WACC of 12.33%. Recommended price: €4.80/share (post-liquidity discount). Demonstrated why P/E multiple is structurally inadequate for leveraged companies.

### 4. [Solar Portfolio Project Finance: 26 MW Assets](./solar-portfolio-project-finance.md)
**Skills:** Project Finance | DSCR Analysis | Multi-Asset Portfolios | Debt Structuring  
Structured €27M project finance for 3-plant solar portfolio with blended revenue streams (FIT, PPA, merchant). Modeled 25-year cash flows with 78% debt gearing. DSCR: 1.84x-2.68x (robust coverage). Identified 43% revenue cliff in Year 21 and recommended 50% asset sale in Year 15 to optimize exit timing.
